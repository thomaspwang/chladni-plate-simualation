    <p>Give a high-level overview of what you implemented in this project. Think about what you've built as a whole. Share your thoughts on what interesting things you've learned from completing the project.</p>
    <br>
    <p>
      In this project, we implemented cloth physics using a spring mesh model, and we added various textures and collision behaviors. First, we implemented the mesh itself 
      simply by iterating over a grid of points. We then implemented physics modeling via Verlet integration, where we approximate the behavior of each point mass in the 
      spring mesh under spring forces, gravity, and pin constraints. We then implemented more realistic behavior by implementing logical collision behavior with 
      spheres and planes, as well as self collisions. We optimized our self-collision implementation by using a hash map to only have to check collisions between point-masses 
      nearby to one another. Finally, we explored GLSL by implementing and comparing diffuse shading, Blinn-Phong shading, texture mapping, bump mapping, displacement mapping, 
      and mirror shading.

      To do so, pause the simulation at the start with <kbd>P</kbd>, modify the values of interest, and then resume by pressing <kbd>P</kbd> again.

      A high <code>ks</code>?
      </small>
    </b></blockquote>

    <p>
      With a very low <code>ks = 50 N/m</code>, we observe that the cloth is extra stretchy, so it is able to bend out of the normal catenary shape in the locations off the 
      pinned diagonals. This appears as "ridges" along the pinned diagonals. With a very high <code>ks = 100000 N/m</code>, we observe that the cloth is 
      extra taut, hanging relatively high and with minimal deflection.

    <blockquote><b>
      <small>
        What about for <code>density</code>?
      </small>
    </b></blockquote>

    <p>
      Changing density has the inverse effect to changing the spring constant. This is because a higher density increases the relative strength of gravity (vs. spring forces), 
      as does lowering the spring constant to weaken spring forces. With a very low <code>density = 1 g/cm^2</code>, we observe again the taut cloth; with a 
      very high <code>density = 100 g/cm^2</code> we observe the same "ridges" we see with a low <code>ks</code>.

    <blockquote><b>
      <small>
        What about for <code>damping</code>?
      </small>
    </b></blockquote>

    <p>
      Increasing damping "slows" the simulation, but also reduces vibrations/bouncing. With a very low <code>damping = 0</code>, we observe aggressive jiggling/bouncing at the bottom 
      of the drop and the cloth does not stabilize after dropping. With a very high <code>damping = 1</code>, the taut cloth does

      Unsurprisingly, with the lower $\text{ks} = 500$, the cloth behaves like a silk handkerchief -- it looks thin and form fits the sphere. 
      It also has many ripples in the cloth as compared to the other experiments. With the higher $\text{ks} = 50000$, the cloth behaves more like 
      a wet towel -- it looks stiff and is less form fit to the sphere. It also has fewer ripples as compared to the other experiments.

      With lower $\text{density} = 1$, the cloth is lighter, so it does not compress as much and creates a few big, loose folds. 
      With higher $\text{density} = 50$, the cloth is heavier, so it compresses more and creates many tighter folds at the bottom. 
      With a lower $\text{ks} = 1,000$, the cloth is looser so it creates smaller, tigher foldes.
      With a higher $\text{ks} = 7,500$, the cloth is stiffer, so it creates larger foldes and does not fold into as tight of a bunch compared to lower $\text{ks}$.

    <blockquote><b>
    Explain in your own words what is a shader program and how vertex and fragment shaders work together to create lighting and material effects.
    </b></blockquote>

    <p>
      A shader program is a parallelizable nugget that computes colors and displacements across a scene. 
      Here, we consider vertex shaders and fragment shaders. Vertex shaders compute and apply vertex displacements, and 
      use this to compute the fragment position, texture, and normal information required for fragment shaders. 
      The fragment shaders then use the outputs of the vertex shaders to compute the screen color of each fragment 
      based on position, normal, and external lighting.

    Explain the Blinn-Phong shading model in your own words.

    </b></blockquote>

    <p>
      The Blinn-Phong shading model approximates lighting as three primary components. The first term is ambient lighting, which captures general softening of shadows and 
      multiple reflections of light. The second term is diffuse lighting, which computes color based on the matte color of objects in the scene. The final term is specular 
      lighting, which captures the bright, concentrated reflections of light off of shiny objects such as latex or metal.

      In bump mapping, it becomes very clear from looking at the edge of the sphere that it is not actually rough (it clearly looks smooth). 
      However, with displacement mapping, the bricks being higher than the mortar is very clear from looking at the edge of the sphere. 
      With a very coarse mesh, these bricks look very angular (almost like triangles instead of trapezoidal bumps); with the finer mesh, the brick pattern looks 
      much more realistic (like actual brick shapes with lower mortar lines in between).
